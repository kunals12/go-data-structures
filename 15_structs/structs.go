/*
ðŸ§  Real-World Use Case:
Imagine you are building an e-commerce system. When an order is received, its status is "Pending". As it gets processed, you update the status to "Confirmed", "Shipped", and eventually "Delivered".

Using pointer receivers allows you to modify the actual Order object, instead of working on a copy.
